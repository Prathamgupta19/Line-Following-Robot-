Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Line Following Robot that can autonomously follow a line on the ground using sensors. The robot uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and adjust its movement accordingly. The goal of the robot is to stay on the track and follow the path from start to finish without deviation.

Components Used
Microcontroller: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any other compatible controller.
IR Sensors: 2-5 IR sensors for line detection.
Motors: DC motors with motor driver (L298N or similar).
Chassis: Robot body frame with wheels.
Power Supply: Battery pack (usually 7.4V or 12V, depending on the motor voltage).
Jumper Wires and Connectors: For connecting components.
